# my-portfolio

## Description
This is my first try at a portfolio I tried to make it aesthetically pleasing It does not currently include any projects. It will soon.
I learned that In the future to set up a nice page in the future I want to be more comfortable with using grid layout to section my webpage more appropriately.
